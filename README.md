# Juan Vicente Reyes porfolio

This is a brief showcase of my skills using html, css and javascript to build a simple web page. It tells you a little bit information about myself, my experience as a Jr Software Developer and uses fetch to consume a news api to show some news of the country and the language you select.

Just feel free to see and learn a little bit about me.
